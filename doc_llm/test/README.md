# Summary

The `copilotdemo` codebase in the `finaxys` project contains a `customer` package for customer management functionalities. This package includes three unit test classes: `CustomerControllerTest.java`, `CustomerMapperTest.java`, and `CustomerServiceTest.java`.

`CustomerControllerTest.java` tests the `CustomerController` for CRUD operations using JUnit 5 and Mockito, ensuring correct results and appropriate HTTP status codes. `CustomerMapperTest.java` tests the `CustomerMapper` class, which maps between `CustomerEntity` and `CustomerDTO` objects, ensuring proper property mapping in both individual and list formats. `CustomerServiceTest.java` tests the `CustomerService` class using JUnit 5 and Mockito, ensuring correct functionality with mock dependencies and proper method implementation.

The `product` package in this codebase currently only contains a `.gitkeep` file, which is a placeholder to ensure the empty directory is tracked in Git version control systems.

2. `CustomerMapperTest.java`: This file tests the `CustomerMapper` class, which maps between `CustomerEntity` and `CustomerDTO` objects. It ensures that the properties are correctly mapped in both individual and list formats.
3. `CustomerServiceTest.java`: This file tests the `CustomerService` class using JUnit 5 and Mockito. It ensures that the class functions correctly with mock dependencies and that its methods are properly implemented.

The `product` package in this codebase currently only contains a `.gitkeep` file, which is a placeholder to ensure that the empty directory is tracked in Git version control systems.
