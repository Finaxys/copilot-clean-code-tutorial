# Summary

The `copilotdemo` codebase in the `finaxys` project has a `customer` package dedicated to customer management functionalities. This package includes several unit test classes:

1. `CustomerControllerTest.java`: This file tests the `CustomerController` for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using JUnit 5 and Mockito. It ensures that the controller returns correct results and appropriate HTTP status codes.
2. `CustomerMapperTest.java`: This file tests the `CustomerMapper` class, which maps between `CustomerEntity` and `CustomerDTO` objects. It ensures that the properties are correctly mapped in both individual and list formats.
3. `CustomerServiceTest.java`: This file tests the `CustomerService` class using JUnit 5 and Mockito. It ensures that the class functions correctly with mock dependencies and that its methods are properly implemented.

The `product` package in this codebase currently only contains a `.gitkeep` file, which is a placeholder to ensure that the empty directory is tracked in Git version control systems.
