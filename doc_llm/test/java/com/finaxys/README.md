# Summary

The `copilotdemo` codebase contains a `customer` package with several unit test classes for the `CustomerController`, `CustomerMapper`, and `CustomerService`.

1. `CustomerControllerTest.java`: This test file verifies the functionality of the `CustomerController` using JUnit 5 and Mockito. It includes tests for CRUD operations such as getting all customers, getting a customer by ID, creating a customer, updating a customer, and deleting a customer. These tests ensure that the `CustomerController` returns expected results and appropriate HTTP status codes.

2. `CustomerMapperTest.java`: This test file validates the `CustomerMapper` class, which maps between `CustomerEntity` and `CustomerDTO` objects. Tests like `testToDTO`, `testToEntity`, `testToDTOList`, and `testToEntityList` confirm that properties are correctly mapped between the objects, in both individual and list formats.

3. `CustomerServiceTest.java`: This test file examines the `CustomerService` class using JUnit 5 and Mockito. It includes tests for `createCustomer`, `getCustomerById`, `getAllCustomers`, `updateCustomer`, and `deleteCustomer`. These tests ensure the correct functioning of the `CustomerService` class with mock dependencies and proper implementation of its methods.

The `product` package contains a `.gitkeep` file, which is a placeholder used in Git version control systems to ensure that an empty directory is still tracked.

## customer

The customer package in `com.finaxys.copilotdemo.customer` contains several unit test classes. The `CustomerControllerTest.java` file tests the `CustomerController` using JUnit 5 and Mockito. It includes CRUD operation tests such as `testGetAllCustomers()`, `testGetCustomerById()`, `testCreateCustomer()`, `testUpdateCustomer()`, and `testDeleteCustomer()`. These tests ensure the `CustomerController` returns expected results and correct HTTP status codes.

The `CustomerMapperTest.java` file tests the `CustomerMapper` class, which maps between `CustomerEntity` and `CustomerDTO` objects. Tests include `testToDTO`, `testToEntity`, `testToDTOList`, and `testToEntityList`. These tests confirm correct property mapping between the objects, in both individual and list formats.

Lastly, the `CustomerServiceTest.java` file tests the `CustomerService` class, also using JUnit 5 and Mockito. It includes tests for `createCustomer`, `getCustomerById`, `getAllCustomers`, `updateCustomer`, and `deleteCustomer`. These tests verify the correct functioning of the `CustomerService` class with mock dependencies and proper implementation of its methods.

## product

The `.gitkeep` file is not a code file but a placeholder used in Git version control systems. When a directory is empty, Git does not track it. However, the addition of a `.gitkeep` file ensures that the directory is still tracked, even if it remains empty. This file is used to maintain a certain directory structure or store configuration files in a Git repository.
