# Summary

The codebase contains several components related to customer management.

1. **Customer Model**: This is composed of two classes: `CustomerDTO` and `CustomerEntity`. `CustomerDTO` is a Data Transfer Object that represents a customer for data transfer between different layers in the application. `CustomerEntity` is a Java Persistence API (JPA) entity that represents a customer in the database. Both classes have properties for customer ID, first name, last name, and age.

2. **Customer Controller**: This is a RESTful API controller annotated with `@RestController` that handles HTTP requests related to customers. It provides endpoints for creating, retrieving (single and all), updating, and deleting customers.

3. **Customer Mapper**: This component is responsible for converting between `CustomerEntity` and `CustomerDTO` objects. It has methods for converting individual objects and lists of objects in both directions.

4. **Customer Repository**: This is a Spring Data JPA repository that manages the persistence and retrieval of `CustomerEntity` objects in the database.

5. **Customer Service**: This is a Spring service that uses the `CustomerRepository` for database operations and the `CustomerMapper` for converting between `CustomerEntity` and `CustomerDTO` objects. It provides methods for creating, retrieving (single and all), updating, and deleting customers.

In summary, the codebase provides a RESTful API for managing customers, with components for handling requests, converting data, managing database operations, and providing business logic.

# Details

## model

**CustomerDTO.java**

The `CustomerDTO.java` file contains a Data Transfer Object (DTO) named `CustomerDTO` in the `com.finaxys.copilotdemo.customer.model` package. This class represents a customer object and includes four properties: `customerId`, `firstName`, `lastName`, and `age`. The Lombok annotations `@Data`, `@Builder`, `@NoArgsConstructor`, and `@AllArgsConstructor` are used to generate boilerplate code such as getters, setters, constructors, and a builder for the `CustomerDTO` class.

**CustomerEntity.java**

The `CustomerEntity.java` file is a Java class named `CustomerEntity`, also located in the `com.finaxys.copilotdemo.customer.model` package. This class represents a customer entity in a database. It is annotated with `@Entity` and `@Table(name = "customer")` to indicate that it is a JPA entity and should be mapped to the 'customer' table in the database. The entity has four properties: `customerId`, `firstName`, `lastName`, and `age`, with the `customerId` being the primary key auto-generated by the database, as indicated by the `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)` annotation. The Lombok annotations `@Data`, `@Builder`, `@NoArgsConstructor`, and `@AllArgsConstructor` are used to generate getters and setters, a builder, a no-argument constructor, and an all-argument constructor respectively for the class, reducing boilerplate code.

In summary, `CustomerDTO` is a DTO used for data transfer between different layers in the application, while `CustomerEntity` is a JPA entity representing a customer in a database with an auto-generated id, a first name, a last name, and an age.

## CustomerController.java

The code package `com.finaxys.copilotdemo.customer` contains a single class, `CustomerController`, which is annotated with `@RestController`. This class is responsible for handling HTTP requests related to customers. It uses the `CustomerService` class for business logic, which is autowired using the `@Autowired` annotation.

The `CustomerController` class has the following endpoints:

1. `@PostMapping`: This method is used to create a new customer. It accepts a `CustomerDTO` object in the request body and returns the created customer with an HTTP status of 201 (Created).

2. `@GetMapping("/{id}")`: This method is used to retrieve a customer by ID. It accepts an ID as a path variable and returns the corresponding customer with an HTTP status of 200 (OK) if found, otherwise 404 (Not Found).

3. `@GetMapping`: This method is used to retrieve all customers. It returns a list of all customers with an HTTP status of 200 (OK).

4. `@PutMapping`: This method is used to update an existing customer. It accepts a `CustomerDTO` object in the request body and returns the updated customer with an HTTP status of 200 (OK).

5. `@DeleteMapping("/{id}")`: This method is used to delete a customer by ID. It accepts an ID as a path variable and returns an HTTP status of 204 (No Content) upon successful deletion.

In summary, this `CustomerController` class provides a RESTful API for managing customers, with the ability to create, retrieve, update, and delete customer records.

## CustomerMapper.java

The `com.finaxys.copilotdemo.customer` package contains a single class, `CustomerMapper`. This class is annotated with `@Component`, which indicates that it is a Spring Bean. The `CustomerMapper` class is responsible for converting between `CustomerEntity` and `CustomerDTO` objects.

The `toDTO` method maps a `CustomerEntity` object to a `CustomerDTO` object, while the `toEntity` method does the reverse. Both methods use the Builder pattern to create their respective objects. The `toDTOList` and `toEntityList` methods convert a list of `CustomerEntity` objects to a list of `CustomerDTO` objects, and vice versa, respectively. These methods utilize Java 8 Streams to perform the conversions.

## CustomerRepository.java

The `com.finaxys.copilotdemo.customer` package contains a single interface named `CustomerRepository`. This interface extends `JpaRepository` from the Spring Data JPA library, indicating that it is a Spring Data repository for the `CustomerEntity` class. The repository is responsible for managing the persistence and retrieval of `CustomerEntity` objects in the database, and it uses JPA (Java Persistence API) for this purpose. The type parameters of `JpaRepository` specify that the repository works with `CustomerEntity` objects and uses `Long` as the primary key type for these objects.

## CustomerService.java

The `com.finaxys.copilotdemo.customer` package contains a `CustomerService` class, which is a Spring service for managing customer operations. This class uses an `@Autowired` `CustomerRepository` for database operations and a `CustomerMapper` for converting between `CustomerEntity` and `CustomerDTO` objects. The service provides methods for creating, retrieving (single and all), updating, and deleting customers. The `CustomerDTO` and `CustomerEntity` classes are used for data transfer and database storage respectively.
