# Summary

**CustomerDTO.java**

The `CustomerDTO.java` file contains a Data Transfer Object (DTO) named `CustomerDTO` in the `com.finaxys.copilotdemo.customer.model` package. This class represents a customer object and includes four properties: `customerId`, `firstName`, `lastName`, and `age`. The Lombok annotations `@Data`, `@Builder`, `@NoArgsConstructor`, and `@AllArgsConstructor` are used to generate boilerplate code such as getters, setters, constructors, and a builder for the `CustomerDTO` class.

**CustomerEntity.java**

The `CustomerEntity.java` file is a Java class named `CustomerEntity`, also located in the `com.finaxys.copilotdemo.customer.model` package. This class represents a customer entity in a database. It is annotated with `@Entity` and `@Table(name = "customer")` to indicate that it is a JPA entity and should be mapped to the 'customer' table in the database. The entity has four properties: `customerId`, `firstName`, `lastName`, and `age`, with the `customerId` being the primary key auto-generated by the database, as indicated by the `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)` annotation. The Lombok annotations `@Data`, `@Builder`, `@NoArgsConstructor`, and `@AllArgsConstructor` are used to generate getters and setters, a builder, a no-argument constructor, and an all-argument constructor respectively for the class, reducing boilerplate code.

In summary, `CustomerDTO` is a DTO used for data transfer between different layers in the application, while `CustomerEntity` is a JPA entity representing a customer in a database with an auto-generated id, a first name, a last name, and an age.

This Java code defines a Data Transfer Object (DTO) named `CustomerDTO` in the package `com.finaxys.copilotdemo.customer.model`. The `CustomerDTO` class represents a customer object and contains four fields: `customerId`, `firstName`, `lastName`, and `age`.

The `@Data`, `@Builder`, `@NoArgsConstructor`, and `@AllArgsConstructor` annotations are from the Project Lombok library. These annotations generate boilerplate code, such as getters, setters, constructors, and a builder for the `CustomerDTO` class.

In summary, this code provides a simple and concise way to create and manipulate customer objects with the given properties.

## CustomerEntity.java

The provided code is a Java class named `CustomerEntity` under the package `com.finaxys.copilotdemo.customer.model`. This class represents the entity for a customer in a database.

The class is annotated with `@Entity` and `@Table(name = "customer")` to indicate that it's a JPA entity and should be mapped to the 'customer' table in the database.
