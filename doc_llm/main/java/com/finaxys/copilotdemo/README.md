# Summary

The provided codebase is a customer management system built using Spring Boot and Java. It includes several components:

1. **Customer Model**: This consists of two classes - `CustomerDTO` and `CustomerEntity`. The former is a Data Transfer Object for data transfer between application layers, while the latter is a Java Persistence API (JPA) entity representing a customer in the database. Both classes contain properties for customer ID, first name, last name, and age.

2. **Customer Controller**: This is a RESTful API controller that handles HTTP requests related to customers. It offers endpoints for creating, retrieving (single and all), updating, and deleting customers.

3. **Customer Mapper**: This component handles the conversion between `CustomerEntity` and `CustomerDTO` objects. It includes methods for converting both individual objects and lists in both directions.

4. **Customer Repository**: This is a Spring Data JPA repository that manages the persistence and retrieval of `CustomerEntity` objects in the database.

5. **Customer Service**: This is a Spring service that uses the `CustomerRepository` for database operations and the `CustomerMapper` for converting between `CustomerEntity` and `CustomerDTO` objects. It offers methods for creating, retrieving (single and all), updating, and deleting customers.

Additionally, the code includes a simple Spring Boot application starter class named `EBusinessApplication`. Annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`, this class starts the application and automatically configures it based on the dependencies in the classpath.

In summary, the codebase provides a RESTful API for managing customers, with components for handling requests, converting data, managing database operations, and providing business logic. The `EBusinessApplication` class is used to run the application and configure it automatically.

# Details

## customer

The codebase contains several components related to customer management.

1. **Customer Model**: This is composed of two classes: `CustomerDTO` and `CustomerEntity`. `CustomerDTO` is a Data Transfer Object that represents a customer for data transfer between different layers in the application. `CustomerEntity` is a Java Persistence API (JPA) entity that represents a customer in the database. Both classes have properties for customer ID, first name, last name, and age.

2. **Customer Controller**: This is a RESTful API controller annotated with `@RestController` that handles HTTP requests related to customers. It provides endpoints for creating, retrieving (single and all), updating, and deleting customers.

3. **Customer Mapper**: This component is responsible for converting between `CustomerEntity` and `CustomerDTO` objects. It has methods for converting individual objects and lists of objects in both directions.

4. **Customer Repository**: This is a Spring Data JPA repository that manages the persistence and retrieval of `CustomerEntity` objects in the database.

5. **Customer Service**: This is a Spring service that uses the `CustomerRepository` for database operations and the `CustomerMapper` for converting between `CustomerEntity` and `CustomerDTO` objects. It provides methods for creating, retrieving (single and all), updating, and deleting customers.

In summary, the codebase provides a RESTful API for managing customers, with components for handling requests, converting data, managing database operations, and providing business logic.

## EBusinessApplication.java

The provided code is a simple Spring Boot application starter class named `EBusinessApplication`. It is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`, which is a combination of `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan` annotations. This means that Spring Boot will automatically configure the application based on the dependencies in the classpath and scan for Spring components.

The `main` method is used to run the application, and it does so by calling `SpringApplication.run(EBusinessApplication.class, args)`. This starts the Spring Boot application context and runs the application.

In summary, this code package consists of a basic Spring Boot application starter class that, when run, will start the application and automatically configure it based on the dependencies in the classpath.
