# Summary

The provided codebase is a customer management system built using Spring Boot and Java. It consists of a RESTful API for managing customers, including endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting customers. The system includes several components:

1. **Customer Model**: This includes `CustomerDTO` for data transfer and `CustomerEntity` for database representation, both containing properties for customer ID, first name, last name, and age.

2. **Customer Controller**: This handles HTTP requests related to customers.

3. **Customer Mapper**: This component converts between `CustomerEntity` and `CustomerDTO` objects.

4. **Customer Repository**: This is a Spring Data JPA repository for managing the persistence and retrieval of `CustomerEntity` objects in the database.

5. **Customer Service**: This uses the `CustomerRepository` for database operations and the `CustomerMapper` for data conversion, offering methods for managing customers.

The `EBusinessApplication` class starts and configures the application automatically.

The provided codebase is a customer management system built using Spring Boot and Java. It includes several components:

1. **Customer Model**: This consists of two classes - `CustomerDTO` and `CustomerEntity`. The former is a Data Transfer Object for data transfer between application layers, while the latter is a Java Persistence API (JPA) entity representing a customer in the database. Both classes contain properties for customer ID, first name, last name, and age.

2. **Customer Controller**: This is a RESTful API controller that handles HTTP requests related to customers. It offers endpoints for creating, retrieving (single and all), updating, and deleting customers.

3. **Customer Mapper**: This component handles the conversion between `CustomerEntity` and `CustomerDTO` objects. It includes methods for converting both individual objects and lists in both directions.

4. **Customer Repository**: This is a Spring Data JPA repository that manages the persistence and retrieval of `CustomerEntity` objects in the database.

5. **Customer Service**: This is a Spring service that uses the `CustomerRepository` for database operations and the `CustomerMapper` for converting between `CustomerEntity` and `CustomerDTO` objects. It offers methods for creating, retrieving (single and all), updating, and deleting customers.

Additionally, the code includes a simple Spring Boot application starter class named `EBusinessApplication`. Annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`, this class starts the application and automatically configures it based on the dependencies in the classpath.

In summary, the codebase provides a RESTful API for managing customers, with components for handling requests, converting data, managing database operations, and providing business logic. The `EBusinessApplication` class is used to run the application and configure it automatically.
