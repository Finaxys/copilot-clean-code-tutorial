# Summary

The Finaxys codebase is a customer management system built using Spring Boot and Java. It provides a RESTful API for handling customer operations, including creation, retrieval, update, and deletion. The main components of the system are Customer Model, Customer Controller, Customer Mapper, Customer Repository, and Customer Service. The application uses an in-memory H2 database and has its schema updated automatically on startup. The API endpoints start with "/api/v1".

The `copilotdemo` codebase under the `finaxys` project includes three unit test classes for customer management functionalities: CustomerControllerTest.java, CustomerMapperTest.java, and CustomerServiceTest.java. These tests ensure the correct operation of their respective classes (CustomerController, CustomerMapper, and CustomerService) using JUnit 5 and Mockito. The product package in this codebase contains only a .gitkeep file as a placeholder for version control.

# Details

## main

The Finaxys codebase is a customer management system developed using Spring Boot and Java. It exposes a RESTful API for handling customer operations such as creation, retrieval, update, and deletion. The key components of the system are:

1. **Customer Model**: Consists of `CustomerDTO` for data transfer and `CustomerEntity` for database representation. Both contain properties for customer ID, first name, last name, and age.
2. **Customer Controller**: Handles HTTP requests related to customers.
3. **Customer Mapper**: Facilitates the conversion between `CustomerEntity` and `CustomerDTO` objects.
4. **Customer Repository**: A Spring Data JPA repository that manages the persistence and retrieval of `CustomerEntity` objects from the database.
5. **Customer Service**: Uses `CustomerRepository` for database operations and `CustomerMapper` for data conversion, offering methods for managing customers.

The `EBusinessApplication` class serves as the application's entry point, handling startup and configuration.

Resources:

1. **application.yml**: A Spring Boot configuration file that sets up an in-memory H2 database for the application, defines the application context path, and enables the H2 console for database inspection.
2. **data.sql**: A SQL script that creates a "customer" table with columns for customer ID, first name, last name, and age, and inserts six records into the table.

The application uses the H2 database, and the schema is updated automatically whenever the application starts. The API endpoints start with "/api/v1".

## test

The `copilotdemo` codebase in the `finaxys` project contains a `customer` package for customer management functionalities. This package includes three unit test classes: `CustomerControllerTest.java`, `CustomerMapperTest.java`, and `CustomerServiceTest.java`.

`CustomerControllerTest.java` tests the `CustomerController` for CRUD operations using JUnit 5 and Mockito, ensuring correct results and appropriate HTTP status codes. `CustomerMapperTest.java` tests the `CustomerMapper` class, which maps between `CustomerEntity` and `CustomerDTO` objects, ensuring proper property mapping in both individual and list formats. `CustomerServiceTest.java` tests the `CustomerService` class using JUnit 5 and Mockito, ensuring correct functionality with mock dependencies and proper method implementation.

The `product` package in this codebase currently only contains a `.gitkeep` file, which is a placeholder to ensure the empty directory is tracked in Git version control systems.
